# Dirty Wordels

This is an attempt at a Wordle clone except using a database of generally NSFW words. If you are unfamiliar with Wordle, you have six guesses to figure out the five letter word. Type the word, and press enter to see the results. Green means you have the correct letter in the correct location, yellow means the letter is in the word, but a different location, and grey indicates that the letter is not in the word at all. Best of luck and I hope you enjoy!
